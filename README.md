##FormEase AI 
🚀The Intelligent, Privacy-First Auto-Fill Assistant.FormEase AI eliminates the tedium of manual data entry.
Unlike standard browser autofill that relies on simple field matching, FormEase uses artificial intelligence to understand the context of web forms—distinguishing between work and personal details, handling complex dropdowns, and predicting answers for job applications, surveys, and e-commerce checkouts.Best of all? Your data never leaves your device. FormEase AI operates with a strict local-storage policy to ensure your privacy.
✨ Key Features🤖 Context-Aware Intelligence: Understands the difference between "Current Employer" and "Previous Employer," or "Shipping Address" and "Billing Address."
⚡ One-Click Filling: Populate entire forms, including text inputs, radio buttons, and dropdowns, with a single click.
🔒 Privacy by Design: All user data is encrypted and stored locally in your browser. No sensitive personal information is ever sent to cloud servers.
📝 Smart Dashboard: Easily manage different profiles (e.g., "Job Application," "Shopping," "Medical Forms") from a centralized dashboard.
🧠 Adaptive Learning: The more you use it, the better it gets at predicting your specific preferences.
